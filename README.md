### 📌 Project Objectives

  * Conduct in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the HR attrition dataset.
  * Preprocess and engineer features to prepare the data for machine learning models.
  * Train and evaluate multiple classification models to identify the best-performing one.
  * Deploy the final predictive model in a user-friendly Streamlit web application.
  * Provide a tool for HR managers to easily predict the attrition risk of employees and visualize key insights.
